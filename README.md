It is an open secret that the hardware in our smart devices contains not only plastics but also conflict minerals such as tungsten, tin, tantalum, silver and gold. Hence, technology is not neutral. In this workshop, given by Patrícia J. Reis (PT/AT) & Stefanie Wuschitz (AT), we investigate alternative hardware from locally sourced materials, so-called ethical hardware, to develop and speculate upon renewable practices for the benefit of both nature and humans.

During the workshop we will make Printed Circuit Boards with natural clay using recycled silver as main electrical conductors. We will model the boards, paint the circuit and fire it in an open fire at Hangar. On our last day participants will solder all electronic components and test our circuit for an interactive microcontroller board that can control digital and analogue sensors as inputs and speakers, leds and motors as outputs. A public presentation of results will take place on 20 October at 7pm and participants will be able to take home the final plaques at the end of the event.

This workshop is part of the “Fem_Lab exchange Catalonia-Austria” project, a collaboration between Mz* Baltazar’s Lab and Hangar, supported by the Delegation of the Government of Catalonia to Central Europe and the Ramon Llull Institute.
